subprocess need to know
1. set input and output file
    use list in subprocess.Popen(args)
    like this:
        subprocess.Popen(['python','hello.py','input.txt','output.txt'])
    it can also add arguments in method Popen() like this to redirect stdin and stdout:
        fin=open('input.txt','r')
        fout=open('output.txt','w')
        p=subprocess.Popen(['python','hello.py'],stdin=fin,stdout=fout)

2. when process end?
    use p.poll() or p.wait() to check if process terminated.
    if return value == None means process is running, else return value is equal to returncode of program.
    if process is not end, use p.terminate() to end it.
3. how to get output?
    read output.txt
4. if process end with error, how to detect it? returncode?
    in python program, use sys.exit(0) to set returncode=0 and end the process
    if returncode!=0, process was end with error.

5. how to access datasetfiles?
    datasetid? inputfiles id?
    output how to relate to dataset?
6. how to access postgre?
