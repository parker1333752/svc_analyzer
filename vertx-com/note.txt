notice
1. vertical is single threaded.
2. vertical can't be blocked, unless use it as worker vertical.
3. use event bus to communicate between verticals.
    (even in different vert.x instance on the same network, see main manual, with '-cluster' option)
4. Vert.x provides a shared map and shared set falicity to share data between vertical in the same Vert.x instance.
5. use sock.pause() and sock.resume() to control socket.
	use sock.write_queue_full and sock.drain_handler to detect queue status.
    Most importantly sock.pause() will not loss data.

tasks
1. use a buffer in sharedData to share data between verticals (for test).
